Kaggle Airbnb Price Predictor

This project builds an Airbnb price prediction model using machine learning. Key features include comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering, such as clustering geographical data, handling missing values, and creating new features like host tenure and property size. Advanced modeling techniques are used, including Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning of CatBoost and LightGBM regressors, and a stacked model combining multiple algorithms. The project incorporates logarithmic price transformation for normalization and leverages modern tools like skopt for parameter tuning and StackingRegressor for ensemble learning.
